Welcome to PyGraphene's documentation!
======================================

Keywords
--------
Any object with keywords will have a base class of base.Kwobject.

Any object with keywords also contains the keywords of all superclasses.

To read a keyword table, the default value for a given keyword is the first
entry in "Possible Values". If the value is a type instead of a value, then
the default entry is in parentheses on the first line.
