Properties
==========
Any object with properties will have a base class of base.PObject.

Any object with properties also contains the properties of all superclasses.

To read a property table, the default value for a given property is the first
entry in "Possible Values". If the value is a type instead of a value, then
the default entry is in parentheses on the first line.
